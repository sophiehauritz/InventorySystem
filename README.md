# Inventory System
  
The assignment was to implement an **inventory and order management system** using an object-oriented approach and a **GUI with DataGrid controls**.

The program allows the user to:
- Add new orders by selecting an item and quantity  
- Queue multiple orders for processing  
- Process the next order one at a time  
- Automatically update the **processed orders list** and **total revenue**  

The left DataGrid shows **queued orders**, and the right DataGrid shows **processed orders**.  
A button at the top allows the user to process the next order, and the total revenue is displayed beside it.

A short screencast (<10s), a class diagram, and a flowchart are included in the repository.
